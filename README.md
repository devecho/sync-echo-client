syncecho-client
===============

##Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Install Node.JS
3. Change your working directory to the repository root and run: ```npm install```
4. To build the app simply run ```grunt dev```
5. Access the output in ```out/dev/``` in your browser via your local web server

## Compatibility
Momentarily, the app is only meant to run in the current version of Google Chrome though this does not imply it won't run in other browsers 'by accident'.
